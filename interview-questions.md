# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: A hash is similar to an array in that it organizes data, but it does this by using key:value pairs. This allows for values to be called by referencing the key, opposed to by an index.    

Researched answer: It is a data structure that consists of a collection of key:value pairs. Values can be assigned to a key by using a hash rocket (=>). 

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is like a snippet of code that has a function. For example, we use a gem to run rspec tests on our code. 

Researched answer: Gems are libraries of code that have specific purposes. They are open source and can be useful to avoid having to write code that has already been done. There are gems that can be used for authentication, security, testing and many other functionalities. 

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer: Ruby on rails is a framework that uses the Ruby language. It is a full stack, open-source application development tool.

Researched answer: Ruby on Rails uses the Model-View-Controller pattern. This breaks down the code into seperate parts but they are connected and is what results in a web application. The model is the data structure of the app, while the view is what displays to the user by using languages like HTML and CSS. The controller is what connects the view to the model. 

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: There is other kinds of databases, one example would be those that are called NoSQL. A relational database is like a table. The columns contain the keys for the data that will be stored in each row, and each row has a unique primary key.

Researched answer: A relational database stores data in tables and is structured. It also takes into consideration the relationship between different data inputs. Using a database of countries as an example, we can see how this happens. When we look for countries in North America, assuming we have continents as a main header in a column, we can query the database and we can get back all those countries that share that relationship. 

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are a unique ID for each instance of a class or thinking about it in a table format, each row. They are important because they can differentiate between similar pieces of data. For example, say we had two students with the same name and in the same cohort. Looking strictly at those two pieces of information, we might assume they are the same student. The primary key allows us to differentiate between the two.

Researched answer: Apart from giving us a unique ID for each set of data, primary keys are important to avoid duplicates. For example, if you had some data with a primary key of 1, you couldn't create another set of data with the same primary key. You could however, call on that primary key and update the data if necessary.  

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: They connect HTTP verbs with CRUD actions and provide a path to specific data. 

2. JSON: It is used to send and receive data. 

3. ERB: Embedded Ruby is an extension that allows for Ruby code to be written in an HTML file for example. As we know, an HTML file is what displays content to a user and with Ruby, we can make that dynamic.  

4. Params: Params is short for parameters and it refers to those specifically used to access user input data.

5. API: Application programming interface allows two applications to communicate. This is done through a request and response cycle. An API is also responsible for the cycle to be succesful by establishing the rules.
